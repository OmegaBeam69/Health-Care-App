Project Details

Health Care App is an android application that can help an user to maintain daily routine of driniking water,eating food and doing exercises. The language that is used to develop this application is "Dart". The frontend is designed with "Flutter SDK" and backend with Google Firebase. Firebase is used for  storing user information as well as user authentication. User can create and login with their respected accounts, therefore if an user forgots their email password then they can recover it easily. After logging in, user will get notified about their BMI status. Depending on user weight app will suggest them how many times they should drink water, on the other hand calories will be suggested based on user age and exercise base on BMI level. The application provided an alarm system where user can select alarm on a specific time and it will notify its user with a local notification on statusbar. There's a section called "medicine info", here an user can set their medicine remider and search about various disease and their information. On profile page user can check about their medicine reminder and history. All of these data will be store and fetched from Google Firebase. So as a result user must have an active internet connection.
